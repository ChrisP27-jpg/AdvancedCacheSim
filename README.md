# AdvancedCacheSim

This is a more advanced cache simulator that takes input from a file containing L (load) or S (save) followed by a hexadecimal number. This simulator shows the results of multiple different cache models including direct mapped, set associative, fully associative, set with no allocation, set with pre-allocation, and prefetch. I've given an example of the input and the output.

## Usage

:$ make

:$ ./cache-sim "input file" "output file"
